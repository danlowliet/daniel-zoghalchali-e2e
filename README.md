Clone the repository

Download Node.js at https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Open a git bash in your project directory

Initiate the project by typing npm init (I included the node_modules in the project but you can use npm init if you choose to not download the node_modules)

Cypress was added as a devDependency to the package.json file so wait until Cypress install

Type ./node_modules/.bin/cypress open in git bash within your project directory (Where Cypress was installed)

This will launch Cypress Test Runner

Click on youtube.spec.js under Integration tests

Select Run all tests
